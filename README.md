# Advent of Code 2023

Repository for my solutions for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Not sure how much time I'll be able to spend on this as December is always busy, but we'll see.

Going to use the latest Java (that I haven't had time to program with) and possibly try out some Kotlin.
